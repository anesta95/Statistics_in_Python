#1. THE RANGE
#So far we've focused entirely on summarizing distributions using the mean,
#the weighted mean, the median, and the mode. An interesting distribution property
#we haven't yet discussed is variability.

#Consider, for instance, these two distributions of numerical values:
#A = [4, 4, 4, 4]
#B = [0, 8, 0, 8]

#The values of the distribution A don't vary -- each value is 4. The values in
#distribution B show some variability -- they are not all identical,
#and the values can either by 8 or 0.  If we were to quantify variability,
#we could assign a value of 0 to A to indicate that it has no variability.
#But what variability value should we assign to distribution B?

#We need a measure to summarize the variability of these two distributions.
#The summary metrics we've learned so far don't tell us anything about variability.
#The mean, the median, and the mode of distribution A are all 4, and
#distribution B has a mean and a median of 4, and no mode.
#If we were to judge variability based on these values,
#we'd probably have to conclude that the variabilities of the two distributions are equal, which is wrong.

#One intuitive way to measure the variability of a distribution is to find the
#difference between the maximum and the minimum value. Both the maximum and the
#minimum of distribution A is 4, so the variability of distribution A is 0:

#max(A) - min(A) = 4 - 4 = 0

#We call this measure of variability the range. So the range of distribution A
#is 0. The range of distribution B is 8:

#max(B) - min(B) = 8 - 0 = 8

#In more general terms, the range of distribution X, where X can be any distribtion
#of real numbers, is:

#range(x) = max(x) - min(x)

#We'll continue in the mission with the data set on house prices we used for the
#last three missions. Here's a short extract from the data set to help you recollect its structure:

#You can find the year of sale in the Yr Sold column.

#1. Prices had the greatest variability in 2008.
#If you consider this sentence true, assign the boolean True to a variable named one, otherwise assign False.
one = False
#Prices variability had a peak in 2007, then the variability started to decrease until 2010
#when there was a short increase in variability compared to the previous year (2009).
#If you consider this sentence true, assign the boolean True to a variable named two, otherwise assign False.
two = True

#2. THE AVERAGE DISTANCE
#The problem with the range is that it considers only two values in the distribution â€”
#the minimum and the maximum value. Consider this distribution C:

#C = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 21]

#We can see there's not much variability in distribution C - we have nine values of 1,
#and a single value of 21. Intuitively, we'd expect the variability of distribution C
#to be greater than 0 because there is some variability after all, but not much greater than 0
#(remember from the last screen that a distribution whose values don't vary should ideally have a variability of 0).

#Despite our expectations, the range indicates that the variability of distribution C is 20.
#max(C) - min(C) = 21 - 1 = 20

#This is signficantly greater than 0 and doesn't seem like a reasonable measure of variability for distribution C.
#The root of the problem is that the range considers only the two extreme values,
#and this makes it extremely sensitive to outliers. To get a more balanced measure of variability for distribution C,
#we need to take into account each value in the distribution.

#To take into account each value when measuring variability we could:

#1. Take a reference value, and measure the distance of each value in the distribution
#from that reference value.

#We can take the mean of the distribution as a reference value.
#Then, we measure the distance between each value in the distribution and the mean.


#2. Find the mean of the distances.
#We first need to sum up all the distances.
#Then we need to divide the total by the number of distances.


#By measuring the distance of each value relative to a reference point and
#then taking the mean of the distances, we practically measure how much the
#values of a distribution vary on average with respect to that reference point.

#It's also very easy to define algebraically this method for any population of values
#[x1, x2, ..., xN] with mean mew:

#average distance = distanceof(x1 - mew) + (x2 - mew) + ... + (xN - mew) / N

#We'll continue discussing about this method in the next screen, but now let's use the
#formula above to measure the variability of distribution C:

#TASKS

#Initialize an empty list.
#Loop through the values of the array. For each iteration:
#Compute the distance between the current value and the mean. Use value - mean every time, as indicated by the formula.
#Append the distance to the list we initialized before the loop.
#At the end of the loop, the list should contain all the distances.
#Return the mean of the list.

    MeanArray = (sum(array) / len(array))

#and assign the result to a variable named avg_distance.

avg_distance = GetAvgDist(C)
print(avg_distance)

#3. MEAN ABSOLUTE DEVIATION
#In the last exercise the average distance was 0.
#This is because the mean is the balance point of the distribution and,
#as we've learned, the total distance of the values that are above the mean is
#the same as the total distance of the values below the mean. The mean mew of the
#distribution C is 3, so we have:

#Plugging the distances into the formula we used in the previous screen will
#make the numerator amount to 0, which in turn will make the average distance 0:

#average distance = -18 + 18 / 10 = 0 / 10 = 0

#To solve this problem, we can take the absolute value of each distance, and then sum up the absolute values.
#The absolute value (also called modulus) of a number is the positive version of that number,
#regardless of its sign. For instance, the absolute value of -7 is +7,
#and the absolute value of +7 is +7. In mathematical notation we write:

#|-7| = +7
#|+7| = +7

#We'll update the formula used previously to reflect the fact the we're summing up the absolute distances instead:

#mean absolute distance = |x1 - mew| + |x2 - mew| + ... + |xN - mew| / N

#We call this measure of variability mean absolute distance.
#In statistical jargon, however, the distance of a value from the mean is called deviation.
#So the mean absolute distance is more commonly known as mean absolute deviation or average absolute deviation.

#Let's take the mean absolute deviation of distribution C and see whether this metric does better than the range.
#Remember that the range is 20, but we expect a smaller value (which is greater than 0 at the same time).

#In the previous screen we transformed the distances to absolute values to avoid
#having the sum of distances amount to 0 in the numerator. Another way to solve
#this problem is to square each distance and then find the mean of all the squared distances:

#mean squared distance = (x1 - mew)^2 + (x2 - mew) + ... +(xN - mew)^2 / N

#This measure of variability is sometimes called mean squared distance or
#mean squared deviation (remember that "distance" and "deviation" are
#synonymous in this context). However, it's more commonly known as variance.


#Squaring the distances or taking their absolute values ensure that we get a
#variability value that is greater than 0 for all distributions that show some
#variability. Notice, however, that variance and mean absolute deviation will
#still be 0 for distributions that show no variability.

#Consider distribution D = [2, 2, 2], which has a variance and a mean absolute deviation of 0:

#C = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,21]. A value of 3.6 fitted well our expectations because

#5. STANDARD DEVIATION
#In the previous exercise, we got a variance of 36 for distribution C = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,21],
#which was much more than we had expected. This high variability value is the direct result of
#the squaring process, which makes most distances much bigger than they actually are.

#Squaring the distances also has the drawback of squaring the units of measurement.
#Let's consider this small sample from the Bedroom AbvGr variable
#(which describes the number of bedrooms in a house):

#[0,7,8]

#For computational purposes, and sometimes for simplicity,
#we tend to leave out the units of measurement in practice,
#but theoretically we should write out the units of measurement:
#[0 bedrooms, 7 bedrooms, 8 bedrooms]

#The units of measurement are subject to algebraic operations,
#so the variance of the sample above will be
#(for formatting purposes, we'll abbreviate "bedrooms" with "b"):

#variance = (0b - 5b)^2 + (7b - 5b)^2 + (8b -5b)^2 / 3
#variance = 25b^2 + 4b^2 + 9b^2 / 3 = 38b^2 / 3 = 12.6b^2

#The variance of this distribution is 12.6(rep) bedrooms^2,
#which is very counterintuitive (12.6(rep) is the abbrevation for 12.666...666.. â€”.  infinitely repeating).
#To solve this problem and also reduce the variability value, we can take the square root of variance.

#6. AVERAGE VARIABILITY AROUND THE MEAN
#In practice, standard deviation is perhaps the most used measure of variability.
#Let's try to get a better understanding of it by measuring the variability of the
#SalePrice variable in our data set. We'll use the GetStdDev() function
#we wrote for the previous exercise:

print(GetStdDev(houses['SalePrice']))

#Standard deviation tells us how much the values in a distribution vary (on average)
#around the mean of that distribution. The mean of the SalePrice variable is approximately $180,796:

print(houses['SalePrice'].mean())
#The mean tells us that the average price of a house is roughly $180,796,
#but this doesn't mean that each house (or most of them) costs exactly $180,796.
#One house could cost $120,000, another $240,000, and it could be that no house
#actually costs exactly $180,796. The standard deviation gives us a picture about this
#variability around the mean sale price. So, on average, sale prices vary by roughly $79,873
#above and below a mean of $180,796.

#Below, we'll try to visualize this variability around the mean by:

#Generating a histogram for the distribution of the SalePrice variable.
#Using vertical lines to mark the mean and the average deviations above and below the mean.

#plt.savefig("Sales_Price_Histogram_with_Std_Devs.png")
plt.close()

#Notice in the histogram that prices can vary around the mean much more or much less than $79,873.
#Some outliers around $700,000 are more than $500,000 above the mean and a couple of houses around
#$30,000 are more than $150,000 below the mean. The standard deviation doesn't set boundaries for
#the values in a distribution: the prices can go above and below the mean more than $79,873.

#7. A MEASURE OF SPREAD
#Another way to understand standard deviation is as a measure of spread in a distribution â€”
#values in a distribution can be more or less spread. We took four random samples of 50 sample
#points each from the SalePrice distribution, and plotted their histograms to visualize the spread for each sample:

#According to our visual estimates, sample 2 has the biggest spread,
#while the other three samples have a similar spread,
#with sample 3 seemingly having the lowest spread.
#The standard deviations of these four distributions fit our visual estimates fairly well:

for i in range(1,5):
    sample = houses['SalePrice'].sample(50, random_state = i)
    # we used the same random states for the samples in the graph above
    st_dev = GetStdDev(sample)
    print('Sample ' + str(i) + ': ' + str(st_dev))

#TASKS
#We took two samples of 50 sample points each from the distribution of the Year Built variable.

#Assign your answer to a variable named bigger_spread. If you think sample 1 has
#a bigger spread, assign the string 'sample 1' to bigger_spread, otherwise assign 'sample 2'.
bigger_spread = 'sample 2'
#Sanity check your visual estimate by computing and comparing the standard deviations of the two samples.

#You can see the two samples already saved in the code editor.

#Assign the standard deviation of sample 1 to a variable named st_dev1.
#Compute the standard deviation using the standard_deviation() function.

#Assign the standard deviation of sample 2 to a variable named st_dev2.
#Compute the standard deviation using the standard_deviation() function.
sample1 = houses['Year Built'].sample(50, random_state = 1)

st_dev1 = GetStdDev(sample1)

st_dev2 = GetStdDev(sample2)
print(st_dev2)

#8. THE SAMPLE STANDARD DEVIATION
#In practice, we generally work with samples,
#but most of the time we're not actually interested in describing the samples.
#Rather, we want to use the samples to make inferences about their corresponding populations.
#Let's find out whether the standard deviation of a sample is a good estimate for
#the standard deviation in the corresponding population.

#Notice in the Standard Deviation formula that we used the population mean mew,
#which means that if we wanted to compute the standard deviation of a sample, we'd have to know mew.
#In practice, mew is almost never known, and we can't find it from our sample either, but we can estimate mew using the sample mean xbar

#We update slightly the formula for the sample standard deviation by changing mew to xbar
#and N to n (remember that N describes the number of data points in a population,
#while n describes the number of data points in a sample):

#Now that we have a working formula, can we use it to reliably estimate the population standard deviation?
#One way we can check this is by sampling repeatedly a known population and
#see how the sample standard deviations compare on average to the population standard deviation.

#TASKS
#Let's consider the data we have for SalePrice a population and sample it 5000 times.
#For each of the 5000 iterations of a for loop:

#Sample 10 data points from the SalePrice variable using the Series.sample() method.
#The random_state of Series.sample() should be 0 for the first iteration,
#1 for the second iteration, 2 for the third, and so on.
#Compute the standard deviation of the sample using the standard_deviation() function.
#Append the standard deviation to a list that will eventually store all the 5000 sample standard deviations.

#Generate a histogram using plt.hist() to visualize the distribution of the 5000 sample standard deviations.

#Draw a vertical line using plt.axvline() to mark the population standard deviation.
#Examine the histogram and try to figure out whether most sample standard deviations cluster above
#or below the population standard deviation, or right at the center of it.

plt.close()

#9. BESSEL'S CORRECTION
#In the last exercise, we plotted the histogram of 5000 sample standard deviations and
#compared them against the population standard deviation.
#Notice that most sample standard deviations are clustered below the population standard deviation:

#This suggests that the sample standard deviation usually underestimates the population standard deviation.
#We can also see that the mean of the 5000 sample standard deviations is below the population standard deviation:

print(stat.mean(SampleStdDevs)) #SampleStdDevs - a list with all the 5000 st. deviations
print(GetStdDev(houses['SalePrice']))

#So we can say that the sample standard deviation underestimates on average the population standard deviation.
#Some sample standard deviations are lower than the population standard deviation,
#some are greater, some may even be equal to the population standard deviation,
#but on average the sample standard deviation is lower than the population standard deviation.

#We can get a good intuition for why the sample standard deviation underestimates if we think in terms of distribution spread.
#When we sample a population, it's generally more likely to get a sample with a spread that's lower than the population's spread.
#This generally translates to a lower standard deviation than in the population.

#Getting a sample with a higher standard deviation than in the population is possible,
#but this is less likely. This is mostly specific to samples with a high spread and no clusters.

#To correct the underestimation problem, we can try to slightly modify the sample
#standard deviation formula to return higher values. One way to do that is to decrease the value of the denominator.
#For instance, 12/6 = 2 in, the denominator is 6. If we decrease the value of the denominator, we get a greater result: 12/4 = 3.

#We'll decrease by 1 the denominator in the sample standard deviation formula.

#This small correction we added to the sample standard deviation
#(dividing by n-1 instead of n) is called Bessel's correction.
#Let's implement Bessel's correction to our standard_deviation() function and repeat the
#steps in the last exercise to see if Bessel's correction adds any improvements.

#TASKS
#Modify the code we wrote in the previous exercise by implementing Bessel's correction, and generate the histogram again.
#If you want to challenge yourself, delete the display code and recode everything from scratch.

#10. STANDARD NOTATION
#It looks like Bessel's correction added some visible improvements and
#partially corrected the underestimation problem.

#The improvement brought by Bessel's correction is more obvious when we compare
#the average values of the two distributions above.
#The mean of the 5000 sample standard deviations without Bessel's correction is roughly 71304,
#while the mean standard deviation of the sample standard deviations having the correction is roughly 75161.
#This is significantly closer to the population standard deviation, which is approximately 79873.

#We could decrease the denominator more (dividing by n-2 maybe) to try improving the correction.
#However, we need a single mathematical definition for the sample standard deviation,
#and we have to choose between n, n-1, n-2, etc.
#Remember that in practice we don't know the population standard deviation,
#so we can't tell which correction would work best for each sample standard deviation.

#Statisticians agree that n-1 is the best choice for the sample standard deviation formula,
#and we'll explore a strong argument in support of this in the next screen.

#Now that we know what formulas to use for samples and populations,
#we introduce some standard notation that will help you understand other statistics resources.
#The population standard deviation is denoted with the Greek letter sigma

#Remember that the population standard deviation sigma is just the square root of the population variance.
#For this reason, the population variance is written as sigma^2
#(such that taking the square root of the variance sigma^2 results in the standard deviation sigma: sqrt(sigma^2)

#The sample standard deviation is simply denoted with s, while the sample variance is denoted with s^2
#(also notice Bessel's correction in the denominator):

#The main takeaway is that we need to use the s and s^2 formulae (with Bessel's correction) for samples.
#For populations, we can use the sigma or sigma^2 formulae (without Bessel's correction).

#TASKS
#We already sampled our data set and saved the sample in a variable named sample.
#Use the Series.std() method to compute the sample standard deviation for the SalePrice column.
#You can use the ddof parameter to choose between  and . Save the result to a variable named pandas_stdev.

#Use the numpy.std() function to compute the sample standard deviation for the SalePrice column.
#You can use the ddof parameter to choose between  and . Save the result to a variable named numpy_stdev.

#Compare pandas_stdev with numpy_stdev using the == operator.
#Assign the result of the comparison to a variable named equal_stdevs.

#Use the Series.var() method to compute the sample variance for the SalePrice column.
#Assign the result to pandas_var.

#Use the numpy.var() function to compute the sample variance for the SalePrice column.
#Assign the result to numpy_var.

#Compare pandas_var with numpy_var using the == operator.
#Assign the result of the comparison to a variable named equal_vars.

#11. SAMPLE VARIANCE -- UNBIASED ESTIMATOR

#In the previous screen, we stated that statisticians agree that n - 1 is better
#than n or n-2 for computing the sample standard deviation s.
#An argument supporting this comes from the fact that the sample variance s^2
#(which uses n-1) is an unbiased estimator for the population variance sigma^2.
#Since standard deviation is just the square root of variance,
#it makes sense to use n-1 as well (although standard deviation is not an unbiased estimator, as we'll see).

#As we learned previously when we discussed the mean, we call a statistic an unbiased
#estimator when that statistic is equal on average to the parameter it estimates.
#Remember that the sample mean xbar is an unbiased estimator for the population mean mew
#no matter whether we sample with or without replacement. The sample variance s^2
#is an unbiased estimator for the population variance sigma^2 only when we sample
#with replacement. In the diagram below, we will:

#Take all possible samples of size n=2 from the population [0,3,6] with sigma=6.
#Compute the sample variance s^2 for each sample.
#Take the mean of all the sample variances s^2. You can see that the mean is 6,
#which is the same as the population variance sigma^2, which shows that the sample
#variance s^2 is an unbiased estimator for the population variance sigma^2.

#In this mission, we learned how to measure the variability of a distribution using the range,
#the mean absolute deviation, the variance, and the standard deviation.
#These metrics are ideal for measuring the variability of distributions whose values are measured on an interval or ratio scale.

#Measuring variability for ordinal and nominal data is much harder because we can't
#quantify the differences between values. For this reason, little is written in the literature about measuring
#variability for ordinal and nominal data. If you want to dig more into this, you can start by reading this paper.

#Next in this course, we'll build on what we know about the mean and the standard deviation and learn about z-scores.
